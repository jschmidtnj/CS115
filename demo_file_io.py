# demo_file_io.py
# Read and write operations on user preferences file.

# File format: Text file, one line per user.  Each line:
# username:artist1,artist2,...,artistN

# To process the file we need to:
# - split into lines
# - for each line, split at the colon, to get username and artists
# - split at commas to get artists
# - remove leading and trailing spaces, and convert all letters to lower case
#   (so comparisons work reasonably).

# Example of putting names in standard format
# example_artist = "  the clash of Death  "
# print example_artist.strip().lower()

# Note if we were to now:
# print example_artist
# it would still be "  the clash of Death  ", as strings
# are immutable and methods that operate on strings actually
# return new strings.
